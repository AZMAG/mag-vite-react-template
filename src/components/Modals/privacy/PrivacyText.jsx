      <p className="mb-3">
        MAG encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you

        MAG does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.
        MAG may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business
        partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In
        those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail,

        In addition, MAG may share data with trusted partners to help us perform
        statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer
        support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are
        prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these
        services to MAG, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality
        of your information.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3">
        MAG does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as
        race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit

        MAG keeps track of its website(s) and pages our customers visit within

      <p className="mb-3">
        MAG will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if
        required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is
        necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal
        process served on MAG or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or
        property of MAG; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the

        Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies
      </h5>
      <p className="mb-3">
        The MAG website(s) use "cookies," pixels, and other technologies on our
        websites to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a
        text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies
        cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
        Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web
        server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3">
        One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
        feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web
        server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you
        personalize MAG pages, or register with MAG sites or services, a cookie
        helps MAG to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This
        simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as
        billing addresses, shipping addresses, etc. When you return to the same
        MAG website(s) the information you previously provided can be retrieved,
        so you can easily use the features that you customized.

        You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers
        automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
        setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline
        cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive
        features of the MAG services or websites you visit.

        We implement Google Analytics to track, monitor, and report website
        traffic. In addition, we use Google Signals, which collects session data
        from sites and apps via Google advertising cookies that Google
        associates with users who have signed into their Google accounts, and
        who have turned on Ads Personalization. This association of data with
        these signed-in users is used to enable cross-device reporting,
        cross-device remarketing, and cross-device conversion and may include
        end-user location, search history, YouTube history, and data from sites
        that partner with Google. These data are used to provide aggregated and

        Security of your Personal Information
      </h5>
      <p className="mb-3">
        MAG secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or
        disclosure. MAG secures the personally identifiable information you
        provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment,
        protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal

      <h5 className="text-lg font-bold">Public Records Law</h5>
      <p className="mb-3">
        MAG is governed by Arizona law and other laws governing the use and
        disclosure of public records. MAG, in some circumstances, is required by
        law to disclose records to people who request them. To the extent that
        any portion of this policy conflicts with or would prevent compulsory
        disclosure under an applicable public records law or compulsory legal
        process, MAG will follow the public records law or compulsory legal
        process.
